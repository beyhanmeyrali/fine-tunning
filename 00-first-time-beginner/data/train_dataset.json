Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is fine-tuning in machine learning?\n\n### Response:\nFine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a specific task by training it on task-specific data. It's much more efficient than training from scratch and often yields better results."

    "text": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nHow do I choose the right model size for my project?\n\n### Response:\nConsider your hardware constraints, latency requirements, and task complexity. Start with smaller models (1-7B) for faster iteration, then scale up if needed. Larger isn't always better."

  {
    "text": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is quantization and why use it?\n\n### Response:\nQuantization reduces model precision from 32-bit to 8-bit or 4-bit, cutting memory usage by 4-8x with minimal quality loss. Essential for running large models on consumer hardware."
